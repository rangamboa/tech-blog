## Description

"tchblg" is a mock-up of a simple tech-oriented blog website. It uses HTML and various javascript packages and engines to display, create and securely store data in the form of user profile info and blog posts.  The page resizes itself dynamically as the screen size changes as a mobile-first site.

## Installation

This project uses HTML and CSS for the front end, Node,js, npm, Express.js and Handlebars.js to handle the scripting, bcrypt for encryption, and Sequelize for data storage and organization. Install them if you do not have them on your local machine. 

## Usage

After installing the required packages above, ``schema.sql`` must be sourced through the MySQL prompt prior to launching the application. Use ``npm run seed`` to then seed the generated database in the command line, then  ``node .\server.js`` to launch this application. I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to visualize, test and troubleshoot API routes.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute. and please follow the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/):

* Fork the reposition

* Push to the branch (``git push origin improve-feature``)
* Create a Pull Request

Thanks!

## Testing

Testing of code was conducted mostly in the browser. I am currently having a lot of trouble seeding the database to even run tests on it, as well as testing the handlebars files, so not much is displayed at this time. I've been trying to break down, rebuild and walk through the code but it is a laborious process.

## Questions

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me via GitHub or email if you've got any questions! Thank you for checking out my code.
